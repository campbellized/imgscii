# Imgscii
Imgscii is a simple program that converts images into ASCII artwork. Follow the prompts and your ASCII art will be printed to your console. I plan on adding more features and improvements in the future.

## Requirements
This program uses the [Pillow](http://python-pillow.org) package to process images and [colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama) package to print to the console in color. Install them from PIP and you're good to go.

```
pip install Pillow
pip install colorama
```

## Usage
Imgscii is run from the console. Use `cd` to navigate to the directory containing
`imgscii.py`and run the program with the following command:

```
python imgscii.py
```

## To-Dos
* Add more options for printing
* Restructure the code into an actual package
* Create more ASCII artwork
